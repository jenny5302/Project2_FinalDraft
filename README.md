# Project2_FinalDraft
This is my final draft of project 2

In this repository, you need the following files to run the code uploaded:
1) Tau_unaligned.fasta - This is the 11 tau protein sequences that we are going to run multiple sequence alignment on

The notebook for running all the codes was written in python. (ipynb)

The packages needed were written at the top of the notebook
